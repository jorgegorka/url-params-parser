# URL Parser

This package relies heavily in the [URL object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL) (no need to reinvent the wheel). It just adds some nice featues to handle params (both query and named params) more easily.

## Install

To install Url Parser:

with npm

```bash
npm i url-params-parser
```

with Yarn

```bash
yarn add url-params-parser
